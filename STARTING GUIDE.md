# Starting Guide

<img src="assets/images/pic 004.jpg" alt="Norrath Navigator Logo" width="720" align="canter">

## Overview
This guide is just a quick rundown of what I do with each new toon that I create. It can be completed solo or with help, i.e., the progression unlock steps will go by faster and easier with help from a higher level. Whether you can get experience with them or not, the kill will count towards your flagging.

It covers the best zones for leveling, when to focus on Alternate Advancement (AA) points, and other essential tips to maximize your experience. Note that this server is tailored for solo or duo play, with everything, including raid bosses, designed to be manageable by small groups. Gear is not essential to complete this guide (especially if you can get help with the boss kills).

The first thing to do is get yourself an EQEmu account and then download and install The Heroes' Journey game client. You can find all the info you need to get started and even optimizations to help make the game run smoother, at The Heroes' Journey Wiki, https://thj-wiki.web.app/.

Once you have your account and are in-game, you are greeted with that old familiar character select screen. This is pretty straightforward. Pick a race, and your initial class, and log in. 

*As of this writing, we cannot use the Drakkin race as a new race, but can race change to them later for plat or Echos of Memory, and the tutorial is not live.*

## Leveling Zones and Progression

### Levels 1-10: Blackburrow
- **Zone**: Blackburrow

### Levels 10-30: Unrest or Castle Mistmoore
- **Zones**: Unrest, Castle Mistmoore
- **Tips**: These zones offer a higher mob density and fast-paced leveling. Unrest is known for its efficient leveling, while Castle Mistmoore provides challenging encounters.

- **Required Kills**: 

- [ ] Lady Vox in Permafrost

- [ ] Lord Nagafen in Solueks Eye


### Levels 30-40: Grimling Forest

## AA Grinding (Pause leveling here to get some AAs)

### Level 56 Dragon Necropolis
- **Zone**: Dragon Necropolis
- **Tips**: Pause at level 56 and focus on AA grinding until you accumulate around 1500 AA points. Prioritize essential AAs for your class, including Combat Agility and Combat Stability. When ready to move on, continue leveling in Dragon Necropolis from 56 to 60.

### Unlocking Planes of Power
- **Required Kills**:

- [ ] Grieg Veneficus in Greig's End

- [ ] Insanity Crawler in The Akheva Ruins

- [ ] Xerkizh the Creator in Ssraeshza Temple

- [ ] Emperor Ssraeshza in Ssraeshza Temple


*These encounters are challenging and may require assistance*.

Once you have access to the Plane of Power (and in turn The Plane of Knowledge), you can start your progression through unlocking the Planes.

*You can access a great walk through on what to do at this point, in game, by hitting Alt+N and reading the story they posted on planar progression*.

### Levels 60-65: Plane of Fire
- **Zone**: Plane of Fire
- **Tips**: At level 60, move to Plane of Fire for efficient leveling and AA farming. This zone offers high-density mobs and excellent experience. Finish your AA grinding between Plane of Fire, Dragon Necropolis, and even Umbral Plains. *If you have not been flagged for PoF yet, DN and UP are great alternatives for leveling and grinding out those last AAs*.

## Money-Making Tip
- **Umbral Plains**: This zone is great for making money by selling loot to vendors. While other zones may not offer valuable loot, Umbral Plains can help you accumulate plat fast.
